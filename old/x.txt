It's just slightly more difficult than web development. To me a big discovery was that you can open developer tools for the browser itself. Here's how to do this:

    Open a devtools on any page

    Go to settings

    Check "enable browser chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes" and "enable remote debugging" checkboxes.

    Close devtools

    Press ctrl+alt+shift+I.

    It will ask you whether to allow connection or not, click ok.

    Browser devtools will open. From there, you can screw around with browser UI as if it were just a webpage. Do note, however, that there are many browser-specific(-moz-) rules which can act quite unlike conventional CSS. Protip: don't touch default rules and element styles, add new rules instead. This will make your changeset cleaner and you won't miss any rule.

    Once you're done, go to "changes" tab, and copy all your changes and plop them into your userchrome.css. If you don't have it, the following is how to create one:

    Open about:config in browser

    Search for toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets

    Set it to True. If there isn't one, create it (Boolean type)

    Open %appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles in windows explorer

    Open your profile folder. If there are multiple and you aren't sure which one you're currently using, consult with about:profiles page in your browser

    There, create a folder named "chrome"

    In there, create a blank userChrome.css file.

    Copy-paste all your rules in there. Make sure they are all wrapped in @-moz-document url(chrome://browser/content/browser.xul) { } selector so that your rules only affect browser UI, not websites and addons.

    Reboot your browser for changes to take effect.

You can also edit addons UI like this. Just go to about:debugging, find addon in question, click "inspect", and switch frame to the second one.
