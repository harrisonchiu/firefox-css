# firefox-css
Minimalist and materialistic design of Firefox interface and creates dark mode for multiple sites.
Plan to make CSS code more efficient (especially CSS for sites). Many attributes don't seem to work without <!important>.

Mozilla seems to want to remove some CSS such as -moz; will update then. 

Works on Firefox 75 (latest stable version).\
Tested on Windows, will test on Linux (Ubuntu) with (for different windows close buttons and movement).
