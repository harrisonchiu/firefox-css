# firefox-css
Minimalist and materialistic design of Firefox interface and creates dark mode for multiple sites.
Plan to make CSS code more efficient. Many attributes don't seem to work without <!important>.

Works as of Firefox 72. Mozilla seems to want to remove some CSS such as -moz; will update then.
